    <h1 class="name">Dead Man Jack</h1>
    <p>
        I worked on aspects of the player for this game. From the movement, to how Jack shoots.
        Anything to do with his grab, or how the player scores points were all done by me.

        The main thing I worked on for Dead Man Jack were the abilities he would
        be able to pick up from grabbing enemies. Each enemy had a different ability 
        they would give Jack when grabbed. Working with regular classes in Unity is 
        a little tougher due to all aspects of an actor being a component. Abilities
        use a component, but get around being one themselves.

        By making the Abilities class serializable, I was able to give each enemy
        type their own ability that they would then transfer to the player when
        they were grabbed by them.

        My absolute favorite ability to create was the bonemerang. You could gain
        this ability by grabbing onto a skeleton. Firing it would send it a ways 
        before it would eventually make its way back to you. It would do this by 
        using a seek behavior with the player character as its target. Simply touching
        the bonermerang would give you the ability again to use as you saw fit. The
        one thing I wasn't as big of a fan of with it was that if you were to catch it
        again, it would replace your current ability.
