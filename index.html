            Skyline Shredder is a comic book-style third-person platformer that focuses on 
            performing complex movements to navigate around an urban environment where your 
            main goal is to achieve as much momentum as possible. Performing various parkour 
            moves will rapidly increase the rate you gain momentum but failing to chain 
            actions or stopping will rapidly decrease your momentum.

        <p class="description">
            Welcome to the brutal Underworld!
            Monsters roam free here. Lead by their unrelenting master, Big Frank 
            the King of Monsters! 
            <br>
            It is here that Dead Man Jack has come to claim the throne from 
            Big Frank. Separating his heart from his own body to give himself 
            immortality, he plans to weave hordes of Big Frank's undead minions 
            to claim the title. With his unique fighting skill, and the freshly 
            opened hole in his chest, he's able to use the abilities of the 
            enemies he grabs and swallows against their own allies.
            <br>
            Fight like your unlife depends on it!
